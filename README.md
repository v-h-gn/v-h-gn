# Hi! I'm Vahagn (Va-HAH-gun).

I'm a CS PhD Student at UCR. My academic interests are artificial intelligence (regression and search tasks), computational biochemistry, chemistry automation, computer architecture, applied mathematics, scientific computing, and work at the intersections of these areas.

My current research is in the area of automating microfluidic design and DNA-based computational models.

I learned to program via Minecraft: I was a developer at [ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra) for some time. 

Other hobbies: cooking, dancing, hiking, reading, playing Dungeons and Dragons, keeping fish and plants, and learning languages.
