# Hi! I'm Vahagn (Va-HAH-gun).

I'm a CS PhD Student at UCR.

My technical interests are artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, computer architecture, applied mathematics, scientific computing, and work at the intersections of these areas.

I also really enjoy playing Minecraft and am a developer at [ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra) as a side hobby (which I wish I had more time to dedicate to :sob:). My last work for PK was developing an API for ability activation that was correct, real time, and easily used by community developers. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, dancing, hiking, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons. I am also an aspiring aquarist.
